twenty-sixteen

We always say it ,but this year is going to be different. This blog is where I will collect my thoughts about harnessing the the power of technology, automation with the spirit of minimalism to build a happy healthy life.

Part of this is learning new skills, or using ones I've already learnt but have yet to put to good use.

Primarily i'm focused on myself in this endeavour, so I may stray further from how others would define the boundaries of tech, but I don't really care. THis blog is for me to organise myself, and if others can benefit from it also that's great.

To start with I won't be working on any sort of posting schedule, though once I settle into the yeat hopefully this will change.

Cheers,
Jeff
