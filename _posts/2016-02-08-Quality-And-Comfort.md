Building a purposeful life is important but difficult. There are a bunch of things that I want toi acheive, but I don't know how exactly. There are elements that I want in my life but I'm not exactly sure how to make the jump from where I am now to where I'd like to be.

This all sound s a bit cryptic, so let's get slightly more concrete.

####housing

 Currently I live in a studio apartment. It's small. It basically is just big enough for my bed and my desk, with the tiniest kitchen space possible. To live what I would class as a real existence I need to have more than this. I understand why lifestyle inflation can be a bad thing. However reasonable levels of lifestyle inflation are a positive part of growing up. I'm nearly thirty, so I can't be living llike a poor uni student forever. If I don't have some sort of lifestyle inflation there isn't much point in working hard for anything, because if I just want to live how I currently am, I'm already able to do that.

##So what do I really want in a new apartment (I only say apartment becaue it is unlikely that I'd find a free standing house in my price range and desired location):
	- At least one bedroom and one living room.
	- The living room should be able to fit both a dining table and a couch area. So I can have people over for dinner, and also relax on the couch when I'd like.
	- I also need to fit my computer setup somewhere. It's not huge but I don't want it to over crowd things.
	- A bigger kitchen, so I can cook new things without feeling cramped.

##What would be nice to have?
	- Internal laundry. I hate not being able to do my washing whenever I like at the moment. I hat having to collect change to pay for it, and then wait for the machine to be free, and need to stick to the opening hours of the shared laundry.
	- Gas stove. Not as important as other things by any means, but cooking with actual fire is soooo much better.
	- External entry. I'd love to be able to walk straight off the street into my place. I'd love to be able to actually have packaes deliverred to my door. This is very low on the list, and in all likelihood will simply be an added bonus if I get it, and not something I'm activly loking for.
